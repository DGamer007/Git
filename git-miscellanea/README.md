# Git Miscellanea: Tools and Techniques

- In VSCode, the **Timeline** tab in the sidebar shows all commits that have modified the currently focused file.

- Before setting up a remote tracking or upstream branch, it's a good practice to run `git fetch` first. This ensures that your local repository is synced with the remote branches and prevents potential errors if the branch hasnâ€™t been fetched locally yet. Once the upstream branch is configured, you can push, pull, or fetch commits without needing to specify the remote and branch names.
